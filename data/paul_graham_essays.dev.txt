what counts as property depends on what works to treat as property
and that not only can change, but has changed
but hunter gatherers didn't treat land, for example, as property in the way we do
[2] but we are in the midst of such a change now
but with the arrival of networks, it's as if we've moved to a planet with a breathable atmosphere
data moves like smells now
but building new things takes too long
people should be able to charge for content when it works to charge for content
but by "works" i mean something more subtle than "when they can get away with it
" i mean when people can charge for content without warping society in order to do it
the crazy legal measures that the labels and studios have been taking have a lot of that flavor
newspapers and magazines are just as screwed, but they are at least declining gracefully
the riaa and mpaa would make us breathe through tubes if they could
ultimately it comes down to common sense
this is where it's helpful to have working democracies and multiple sovereign countries
private property is an extremely useful ideaarguably one of our greatest inventions
so far, each new definition of it has brought us increasing material wealth
[4] it seems reasonable to suppose the newest one will too
in this essay i'm going to demonstrate this phenomenon by describing some
any one of them could make you a billionaire
don't worry, it's not a sign of weakness
arguably it's a sign of sanity
the biggest startup ideas are terrifying
and not just because they'd be a lot of work
she says to him:
here's the thing: if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me
that's what these ideas say to us
this phenomenon is one of the most important things you can understand about startups
[1] you'd expect big startup ideas to be attractive, but actually they tend to repel you
and that has a bunch of consequences
even the most ambitious people are probably best off approaching them obliquely
a new search engine
the best ideas are just on the right side of impossible
i don't know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be
that was not a natural move for microsoft
they did it because they were afraid of google, and google was in the search business
microsoft : google :: google : facebook
google used to give me a page of the right answers, fast, with no clutter
and the pages don't have the clean, sparse feel they used to
google search results used to look like the output of a unix utility
now if i accidentally put the cursor in the wrong place, anything might happen
the way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers use
and for the first time in over a decade the idea of switching seems thinkable to me
feel free to make it excessively hackerish
make it really good for code search, for example
replace email
email was not designed to be used the way we use it now
email is not a messaging protocol
it's a todo list
or rather, my inbox is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it
but it is a disastrously bad todo list
as a todo list protocol, the new protocol should give more power to the recipient than email does
i want there to be more restrictions on what someone can put on my todo list
) when does it have to be done?
this is one of those ideas that's like an irresistible force meeting an immovable object
on one hand, entrenched protocols are impossible to replace
and if email is going to get replaced eventually, why not now?
they're all at the mercy of email too
whatever you build, make it fast
gmail has become painfully slow
gmail is slow because google can't afford to spend a lot on it
but people will pay for this
i'd have no problem paying $50 a month
at least $1000 a month
replace universities
people are all over this idea lately, and i think they're onto something
one could do a lot better for a lot less money
i don't think universities will disappear
they won't be replaced wholesale
they'll just lose the de facto monopoly on certain types of learning that they once had
y combinator itself is arguably one of them
if learning breaks up into many little pieces, credentialling may separate from it
universities seem the place to start
internet drama
hollywood has been slow to embrace the internet
a lot of the reason is the horribleness of cable clients, also known as tvs
our family didn't wait for apple tv
we hated our last tv so much that a few months ago we replaced it with an imac bolted to the wall
more can be stolen by things that are a little more closely related, like games
there are two ways delivery and payment could play out
if that's the way things play out, there will also be a need for such infrastructure companies
the next steve jobs
his answer was simply "no
" i already feared that would be the answer
i asked more to see how he'd qualify it
but he didn't qualify it at all
no, there will be no more great new stuff beyond whatever's currently in the pipeline
so if apple's not going to make the next ipad, who is? none of the existing players
so the company that creates the next wave of hardware is probably going to have to be a startup
i realize it sounds preposterously ambitious for a startup to try to become as big as apple
but no more ambitious than it was for apple to become as big as apple, and they did it
steve jobs has shown us what's possible
now steve is gone there's a vacuum we can all feel
if a new company led boldly into the future of hardware, users would follow
the ceo of that company, the "next steve jobs," might not measure up to steve jobs
but he wouldn't have to
he'd just have to do a better job than samsung and hp and nokia, and that seems pretty doable
bring back moore's law
the last 10 years have reminded us what moore's law actually says
actually what it says is that circuit densities will double every 18 months
it used to seem pedantic to point that out
not any more
intel can no longer give us faster cpus, just more of them
this moore's law is not as good as the old one
there are several ways to approach this problem
and if it's not impossible but simply very hard, it might be worth trying to write it
the expected value would be high even if the chance of succeeding was low
the reason the expected value is so high is web services
and that would in turn mean that you got practically all the users
they'd take most of intel's business
then the programmer still does much of the work of optimization
these people might be your employees, or you might create a marketplace for optimization
i realize how crazy all this sounds
in fact, what i like about this idea is all the different ways in which it's wrong
trying to write the sufficiently smart compiler is by definition a mistake
now that's what i call a startup idea
ongoing diagnosis
for example, in 2004 bill clinton found he was feeling short of breath
it seems reasonable to assume bill clinton has the best medical care available
ditto for cancer
cancer will show up on some sort of radar screen immediately
(of course, what shows up on the radar screen may be different from what we think of now as cancer
for example, a friend of mine once had her brain scanned as part of a study
she was horrified when the doctors running the study discovered what appeared to be a large tumor
after further testing, it turned out to be a harmless cyst
but it cost her a few days of terror
but i think that's just an artifact of current limitations
there is room for a lot of startups here
let me conclude with some tactical advice
don't say, for example, that you're going to replace email
if you do that you raise too many expectations
just say you're building todo-list software
that sounds harmless
people can notice you've replaced email when it's a fait accompli
empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things
empirically, it's not just for other people that you need to start small
you need to for your own sake
neither bill gates nor mark zuckerberg knew at first how big their companies were going to get
all they knew was that they were onto something
you'll be better off if you operate like columbus and just head in a general westerly direction
start with something you know works, and when you expand, expand westward
it felt as if there was some kind of wall between us
i could never quite tell if they understood what i was saying
you won't have to babysit the round to make sure it happens
was there some kind of inverse relation between resourcefulness and being hard to talk to?
you don't have to explain in detail; they'll chase down all the implications
that's the connection
it's conversational resourcefulness
they traversed idea space as gingerly as a very old person traverses the physical world
the unsuccessful founders weren't stupid
they just weren't eager to
so being hard to talk to was not what was killing the unsuccessful startups
it was a sign of an underlying lack of resourcefulness
that's what was killing them
but the most immediate evidence i had that something was amiss was that i couldn't talk to them
there are great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under our noses
one reason we don't see them is a phenomenon i call schlep blindness
schlep was originally a yiddish word but has passed into general use in the us
it means a tedious, unpleasant task
no one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them
maybe that's possible, but i haven't seen it
one of the many things we do at y combinator is teach hackers about the inevitability of schleps
no, you can't start a startup by just writing code
i remember going through this realization myself
a company is defined by the schleps it will undertake
and schleps should be dealt with the same way you'd deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in
the most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much of it is unconscious
your unconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful schleps
that's schlep blindness
the phenomenon isn't limited to startups
their unconscious mind decides for them, shrinking from the work involved
the most striking example i know of schlep blindness is stripe, or rather stripe's idea
thousands of people must have known about this problem
you'd have to make deals with banks
plus there are probably all sorts of regulations to comply with
it's a lot more intimidating to start a startup like this than a recipe site
that scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable
(this is also true of starting a startup generally
maybe that's one reason the most successful startups of all so often have young founders
in practice the founders grow with the problems
but no one seems able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders
they don't know how much they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to
older founders only make the first mistake
ignorance can't solve everything though
some ideas so obviously entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them
how do you see ideas like that? the trick i recommend is to take yourself out of the picture
somehow it's as if most places were sprayed with startupicide
i wondered about this for years
a couple weeks ago i finally figured it out
i was framing the question wrong
the problem is not that most towns kill startups
it's that death is the default for startups, and most towns don't save them
startups in other places are just doing what startups naturally do: fail
the real question is, what's saving startups in places like silicon valley? [2]
environment
and what drives them both is the number of startup people around you
it's quite a leap to start a startup
it's an unusual thing to do
but in silicon valley it seems normal
in most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as if you're unemployed
having people around you care about what you're doing is an extraordinarily powerful force
even the most willful people are susceptible to it
he responded so eagerly that for about half a second i found myself considering doing it
in most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't seem real
in the valley it's not only real but fashionable
that no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't
but i think that's ok
the second component of the antidote is chance meetings with people who can help you
the reason startups are more likely to make it here is that great things happen to them too
in the valley, lightning has a sign bit
and moreover has advanced views, for 2004, on founders retaining control of their companies
you can't say precisely what the miracle will be, or even for sure that one will happen
i bet this is true even for startups we fund
chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in having ideas
the critical thing in both cases is that they drift just the right amount
the meeting between larry page and sergey brin was a good example
for larry page the most important component of the antidote was sergey brin, and vice versa
the antidote is people
i'm not sure why this is so
a large part of yc's function is to accelerate that process
to make a startup hub, you need a lot of people interested in startups
there are three reasons
the first, obviously, is that if you don't have enough density, the chance meetings don't happen
sean parker was exactly what facebook needed in 2004
this is one of the reasons we fund such a large number of companies, incidentally
in most places the atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean
i flew into the bay area a few days ago
i notice this every time i fly over the valley: somehow you can sense something is going on
obviously you can sense prosperity in how well kept a place looks
but there are different kinds of prosperity
silicon valley doesn't look like boston, or new york, or la, or dc
